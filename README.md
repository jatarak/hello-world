# hello-world
First repository 

Hi all!

I am new to Github and new to programming as well! I am in the process of self-teaching to become a front-end web developer, but I would love to be a full stack developer eventually. I have learned HTML and CSS and I am perfecting those skills while I am starting to learn JavaScript. I am having so much fun learning and I'm exciting to keep increasing my skill based knowledge. Prior to learning to program I went to school to be a Behavior Analyst. I'm currently working as a Researcher for a company who specializes in online voter guides. When I'm not working or learning to code, I'm spending all of my free time with my daughter who is 6 months old! I love watching tv shows (especially binge watching shows on Netflix or Hulu) and playing my PS4. I'm a big foodie and I love dogs. I have 2 of my own.
